It is a special class of neural networks specifically used for sequences,nlp related task.

In the examples of iq,marks,placemet if i interchange iq and marks in our input layer in the ANN,then the final result will not vary.so,in this type of problem sequence
does not matter.
in text data-sequence matters.
time series based data-stocks of a company over time
speech data
dna sequence

Till now we have not seen a neuralnetwork where we can vary the i/p size
In text classification problem we see that input size varies.
textual data can be of different size.
we can use zero padding-but what if we have a vocabulary of 10k words-lots of irrelevent work.-number of weights increases.
and what if in test data there is a point having 200 words,then 0 padding will also fail.
ANN does not have the capability of memory to seggregate what came first and what last.

Applications:-
1)Sentiment Analysis-we get a text i/p and we need to find the sentiment in that i/p text.

2)sentence completions eg. in gmail,phone keypad
3)Image caption generator,video comentary(used by blind people to listen to the commentary of what they see)
4)Google translator,language detector
5)Question and answer demo(give a paragraph as i/p and get answers to the question you ask to it)
5)Time series forcasting
6)speech classification
